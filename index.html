            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a kdb+ developer at KX. Prior I was an associate professor of mathematics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
                I completed my Ph.D. at University of Campinas (with a one year visit at University of Ottawa in Canada) 
                under the supervision of Adriano Moura and Alistair Savage. 
                After that, I spent one year as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Jacobs University in Germany.
                My research interests are: representation theory of (quantum) Lie (super)algebras, and homological methods.
