    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a kdb+ developer at KX. Prior I was an associate professor of mathematics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
        I completed my Ph.D. at University of Campinas (with a one year visit at University of Ottawa in Canada) 
        under the supervision of Adriano Moura and Alistair Savage. 
        After that, I spent one year as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Jacobs University in Germany.
        My research interests are: representation theory of (quantum) Lie (super)algebras, and homological methods.
